At the start, it could be overwhelming to explore a new product. We wanted to give you some head start to start with the basics and then slowly explore the features at your phase. 

## 1. View your knowledge base
There are two parts to Document360. An admin portal (what you are seeing here) for authors to create content and a knowledge base site (can be public or private) for the end-users (like customers, internal teams, etc) to read the content. 

Here is the link to your knowledge base [https://dev-and-qa-isssues.document360.net](https://dev-and-qa-isssues.document360.net). 

The knowledge base then got two important factors. A professional-looking **Customize site - Home** and [the docs](https://dev-and-qa-isssues.document360.net/docs) (the knowledge base content).

Using the home page builder, you can change the look and feel, without requiring any developer support. You can also completely disable if you don't need the home page. 

## 2. Categories Management
On the left-hand side, you'll see a few different categories created each with some articles. Let's take a look at some of the action you can perform to maintain a good Category structure.

You can easily *add, delete, hide, rename, move* categories from the left-hand side using few ways. 
* You can click on the **Add category** to add top-level categories
* Sub-Categories can be created by either using the **fly-out menu** at any particular position or the **context menu** ". . ." at a specific category. Mouse over the categories and you'll see these options coming.
